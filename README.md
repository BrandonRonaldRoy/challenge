Challenge:
Run the command git clone https://github.com/BrandonRonaldRoy/challenge.git
The repo has the master and 2 feature branches: feature1, and feature2
(When you clone the repo and try to check the branches they won’t show up. You should still be able to checkout by using their names directly.)
Each feature branch has some of the correct answers, using rebase, make the statements correct on main.

Once completed, create an empty repo in GitHub. Remove the current remote origin from the challenge and edit package.json to point towards your new repo. Deploy the code using gp-pages from your repo, you may need to run npm install gh-pages –save-dev first.
